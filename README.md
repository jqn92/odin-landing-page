# Foundations Course
## Project - Landing Page
In this project, I am going to build a landing page for **The Odin Project**'s Foundations Course. First, I will deal with the basic **HTML** structure. Then, I will add **CSS** to style the content and rearrange the layout.
<br>
The page will consist of **a header**, **a footer** and the content, divided into **a hero section**, **an info section**, **a quote section** and **a call to action section**.
<br>
<br>
### HTML Structure
#### Header
The **header** will be made up of *some text* on the left representing the logo and *three links* on the right, representing the menu.
<br>
#### Hero Section
The **hero section** will be made up of *a media object*, that is, *a header*, *some text* and *a button*, on one side, and *an image*, on the other. 
<br>
#### Info Section
The **info section** will include *a header* and *four cards*, that is, four *images* and their corresponding *descriptions*.
<br>
#### Quote Section
The **quote section** will have *a block quotation*, that is, *a block of text* (an extract) and *a line of text* mentioning the cited speaker.
<br>
#### Call to Action Section
The **call to action section** will contain *a header* and *some text* calling for action, on the left side, and *a button*, on the right side. 
<br>
#### Footer
The **footer** will consist of a *copyright statement*.
<br>
### CSS
Except for the **header** and the **hero section**, sections will be clearly divided by different, yet complementary, background colors.
<br>
I will make use of flex for arranging the page's layout in a column and centering each section's content.
